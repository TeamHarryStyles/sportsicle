### Application Structure
The application is built as a series of models that interconnect to create 
was is essentially numbers game for fantasy basketball.
With the power of sports radar, we are able to collect and aggregate data
too our needs and create a database of basketball players who all have
unique scores and a matching id on our and sports radar's API. 

We use this data to allow users to collect their favorite players and 
aggregate a score for their team and then compare their teams to 
each other in a global league and adjust their
teams however they want.

Both teams and users have their own clearly defined models and 
features. Users are capable of granting permissions the public
and generating associated teams for users. While Teams are easily 
mutatable for the users benefit.
